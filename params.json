The \"groupedOptions\" Array which includes the title-value pairs that we'll eventually use inside the Select box. Note that grouped option in this array is an Ember object that holds a 'label' and a 'content'.\r\nThe 'content' part includes an internal Ember Array which holds the actual title value pairs.\r\nThe sample also includes a special Ember.Object (App.GroupedOption) which may be used later to obtain the actual selected title value pair.\r\nThe 'label' part holds the group name\r\n\r\n2. The 'flattenedGroupedOptions' is a simple array that holds all the title value pairs as in a regular Ember.Select object (this is the hack)\r\n\r\n3. The 'groupedSelectedCtrl' is using our extended Ember.GroupedSelect object and it is the object that eventually does the Opt group for us.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
